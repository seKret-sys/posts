Today i'm going to talk about **APT Attacks**.
APT its the short of "Advanced Persistent Threats", this type of threat targets the weakest link in the chain, the human factor.
This types of attacks take a long time to preparsssse, the strategy and the knowing of the target its one of the most important things in this type of attack. The attackers can be inside the organizations a lot of time gathering information for the next stage.
The main motivations of this attacks are political reasons, financial, business rivalry, etc...
There are different APT vectors:

· **Spear-phising**
testof this vector its sending a email with a malicious word document to an employee, when the employee opens the document, he will be infected.

· **Drive-By Download**
This technique consists in sending to an employee a link to a malicious website, this website with an exploit (an exploit its a piece of malware that exploits a vulnerability) will force the victims browser to execute whatever the attacker wants.

· **Watering Hole**
This vector uses website ads for infect the victim. The ad will redirect the victim to another webpage thats will scan your browser looking for vulnerabilities to exploit, once the scan its finish, if there is any discovery the webpage will load an exploit to take an approach of this found vulnerability.

· **Hacking the supply chains**
The targets surely use third party things, like third party software, maybe this third party enterprise have a low security and its more easy to hack them than our target, we as attackers will hack this third party enterprise and give to our target a new version of the software their are using but trojanized, this is an example of this vector.

· **Insider**
This vector consists in pay an employee to infect a server o certain systems. An example its paying a cleaner $30k for access the server room or the responsible of the building room and put into the server a usb, this usb will have a malware inside and will infect the system that will give us the access to the network.
