In this post im going to analyse a .pcap, this network capture have malware traffic.
You can download the sample im going to analyse in https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/2020/05/28/.
The questions i have to answer are the following:

1. Based on the Trickbot infection's HTTP POST traffic, what is the IP address, host name, and user account name for the infected Windows client?

2. What is the other user account name and other Windows client host name found in the Trickbot HTTP POST traffic?

3. What is the infected user's email password?

4. Two Windows executable files are sent in the network traffic.  What are the SHA256 file hashes for these files?

The first thing i do its open the sample with wireshark:

The first questions says "Based on the Trickbot infection's HTTP POST traffic, what is the IP address, host name, and user account name for the infected Windows client?", the question give us valuable information like how the malware comunicate back with the attacker, using http protocol, lets put a filter in wireshark to view only http traffic.

Im going to put here the request and response of each http comunicattion.
The first is this (packet 20 and 22):
![](https://i.imgur.com/V293wQ5.png)
Its a GET Request using curl (we know this thanks to the useragent) to api.ipify.org, the response its a public ip address, i suppose this public ip its the organization public IP.
The next couple of packets are the following:
![](https://i.imgur.com/T2FKN1g.png)
Its doing a POST request to a webserver with the ip address `36.89.106.69`, the interesting here its URI what are requesting for `/yas33/CAT-BOMB-W7-PC_W617601.1071BE9788304FBD0C52B1EE36701166/83/`, `yass33`, `CAT-BOMB-W7-PC_W617601.1071BE9788304FBD0C52B1EE36701166`, `83` a code, this code can be random or not, we dont know it yet.
The next couple of packet are the following:
![](https://i.imgur.com/q8Mezje.png)
This looks more interesting, its sending to the same webserver email passwords `pop3://mail.catbomber.net:995|phillip.ghent|gh3ntf@st`. If you look the URI has changed a little bit, the code is not the same now its 81.
The following packets are:
![](https://i.imgur.com/vDVYBTj.png)
In this request looks like the malware its harvesting "OpenVPN password and configs" and didnt find nothing, this is the reason why the data section its empty, if you look at the code in the URI you can see its `81`, looks like all the passwords can harvest the malware its send to that code in the webserver.
The following packets are this:
![](https://i.imgur.com/pk58YXm.png)
Its look same the as the previous, but this time its trying to get OpenSSH private keys, its sending the information to the the code `81`.
At this point we can ensure that the in the URI its not random.
The next packets are the following:
```

The malware its sending to the attacker all the information can harvest about the target. With this information at this point we can answer some questions. See answers in answers section. 

We can answer the three first questions, now we must find the executables the malware is sending to the infected machine. 
Knowing that the malware exchanges information via HTTP i look into all the requests finding this executable and i found to 2 request to 2 .png images, this couple of resquests looks suspicious.

If i follow the request to imgpaper.png we view the webserver its replying it with a executable. We know its a executable because its starting with a MZ, all the PE Executables starts with a MZ at the beggining.
![](https://i.imgur.com/uahbyoC.png)
If i follow the request of cursor.png its the same thing.
![](https://i.imgur.com/nZxhUSh.png)
I export this 2 objects and i calculate the checksum of each one. See at answers section.
